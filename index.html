    <p>
     Masindi Mbolekwa (b.2002) is a visual artist from Johannesburg. His practice is concerned with pic
torial space and the ways in which it is utilized in the creation of a dialogue between metaphysical/
abstract and material/representational realms in the canon of painting. It is a poetically loaded engage
ment with personal and cultural history and the ontology of natal alienation within a postcolony through 
the consideration of forms of earth as spiritual, and the use of abstract form, colour contrast, bodily 
gesture and archived knowledges as a language to communicate narrative and myth as well as facili
tate emotive experience.  
Mbolekwa holds an Honours in Fine Art from the University of The Witwatersrand (2023). His first 
Solo presentation “Feast of Flesh and Prayer” was held at Ellis House Gallery in May 2025. He 
has participated in various group exhibitions including ‘Screen-In-Time’ (2022), ‘Siyabuka’ (2023), 
‘Crossroads: Tsila Tse Pedi’ (2024), ‘Figurative Frontiers’ (2024), and ‘Tswela 
Pele’ (2025).
In the year 2024 Mbolekwa was featured in Wanted Magazine’s annual ‘Young and Vital’ artists list, 
shorlisted for the Cssirer Welz Prize, and was the recipient of a senior residency with the artist collec
tive Blvck Block.
